# Responsive-NavBars

##Introduction
The responsive navbar is a user interface element that adjusts its layout and behavior based on the screen size of the device it is viewed on. It is designed to provide optimal navigation experience for users on both desktop and mobile devices.

When viewed on a desktop or larger screen, the responsive navbar typically appears as a horizontal menu bar at the top of the webpage. It is usually placed within a "nav" element and contains a list of navigation links represented by "a" tags inside "li" elements. The navbar may also include a site logo or branding elements.

As the screen size decreases, such as on tablets or mobile phones, the responsive navbar adapts its layout to conserve space and ensure easy access to the navigation links. The specific behavior of the responsive navbar can vary depending on the design and implementation, but common techniques include:

Collapsed/Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens, the navbar may collapse into a single button or an icon (often referred to as the "hamburger" icon) to save space. Clicking on this button reveals a dropdown menu with the navigation links.
